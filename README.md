[100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/)
- ["BMI 2.0 Calculator"](https://github.com/mmbperson/Learner-Projects/blob/main/%22BMI%20Calculator%20%22_2): Using what I learned from if/elif/else to create another program that interprets information based on input.
- [Leap Year](https://github.com/mmbperson/Learner-Projects/blob/main/Leap%20Year%20(IfElse)): This one was honestly a little tricky! [I realized that with the right set of limited input the program could easily *seem* accurate without being accurate.](https://github.com/mmbperson/Learner-Projects/blob/main/Leap%20Year%20(Elif)) I had to run several tests to ensure that it hit all the parameters of "divisible by 4, **except** every year that is evenly divisible by 100 with no remainder, **unless** the year is also divisble by 100 with no remainder." This project honestly made me excited to look forward to future tester work!
- [Love Calculator](https://github.com/mmbperson/Learner-Projects/blob/main/Love%20Calculator): I took everything I had learned so far about input variables, types, strings, if/elif/else, and added count() to that to create this "calculator" that adds up the letters in a name to determine your match status.

## More About Me
Accessibility is a driving motivator for me to learn code. I just want to know that my friends and community members can have at least the basic access that they deserve. Here are some of the ways I used my love of my community to provide accessibility work
:
- In 2019, the year of my autism diagnosis, I entered into an art fellowship. For my project [Express Unbound](https://www.facebook.com/events/790936188032948/790936194699614/?active_tab=discussion) I spent the bulk of my time getting to understand the diversity in accessibility to better understand the creativity & flexibility required to navigate any potential conflicts in accessibility that could show up with participants. I had fully intended to continue on with these events, until COVID came. There was some impact to my health, but I would still use what I learned to create virtual spaces.
- Before Twitter had Alt Text options, there were still many of us providing Alt Text for our friends. I had created [Accessibility Things](https://riahsweirdjourney.com/category/accessibility-things/) for the longer text and descriptions, and would later use this part of my website for captioning as well.
- Collaborating with organizations and individuals around making accessible hybrid events. 
- Volunteer in connecting nonprofits to captioning services for their virtual events, and embedding the live transcriptions to the event whether by Zoom key or OBS overlay.
- Volunteer to do Live Audio Descriptions for the [Birmingham 2022 Commonwealth Games](https://www.bbc.com/sport/live/commonwealth-games/60855425) closing ceremony via [BSL Connect](bsl.digital).
